# One Button Controller
A controller built with open-source electronics and designed to play any game with a single button.

UPDATE:
Now includes XInput Support

UPDATE 3/9/2020:
I noticed that Rudeism actually went and made a one button controller himself. While his was purpose-programmed for Super Mario 64, he approached the Morse code solution in a much better way than I did. Though downtrodden and defeated, I wanted to see if I could reprogram my current controller to perform like his. And lo, now it is more responsive though I think there might still be issues if you need buttons to be held.
